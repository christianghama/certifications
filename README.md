In this page you can find information about the courses I have done in various areas such as cloud computing, cyber security, devops, project management etc. Along my carreer I have attended almost 100 formation courses! However, I decided to prioritize in this page those that are more aligned with the professional challenges I have been searching in the last ten years. Be advised that since I am a continuous learner, this list is in constant update.
Below I provide the details about all my courses organized by knowledge areas.
